                        One day my brother decided to join the Cub Scouts of America, and so naturally I joined as 
                        well. The difference is, my brother is two years younger than me, so he joined as a Bear 
                        Scout, while I joined as a Webelos. With four months until I bridge to a Boy Scout. 
                        Quite late to the party I was.<br>
                        Nonetheless, I joined and very shortly after bridged into Boy Scouts. I have no regrets 
                        joining Boy Scouts as it really did teach me so many things I couldn't have learned 
                        otherwise: the expected things like camping/outdoorsmanship, knots, first aid, 
                        fire safety and such, but also less tangible things like how to be a good leader, 
                        how to effectively help/teach someone else, and how to work in a team.<br>
                        And I also had a great time, making friends, going camping all the time (which I already
                        did with my family before so now I got to go even more!), learning things from adults
                        who had so much to share (and loved sharing it). I even had the honor of becoming an
                        Eagle Scout and Eagling out.<br>
                        Now, I carry what I've gained with me in everything I do, and I've been pleasantly 
                        surprised at just how often I use what I've learned. I'm sure it will serve me well 
                        far into the future, and I know that no matter how the future may turn out, I will <strong>
